# PCA
Math in code. Principal Component Analisys on matricies

## PCA Matrix Calculator
Welcome to the PCA Matrix Calculator project, where Iâ€™ll save you some tears over manual calculations. we're about to make your life a whole lot easier!

## Unveiling the Inspiration
Back in the days of my master's studies, PCA appeared as this overwhelmingly complex concept, especially when calculating it by hand. But then, as I delved deeper into the realms of coding, my mind couldn't help but revisit those old student papers. So now Iâ€™m sharing it with all my fellow students of Statistical Methods in Economics at UNECON.

# The Power of PCA at Your Fingertips
Say goodbye to manual PCA calculations. Here's what you get from this PCA Matrix Calculator: Reconstruction matrix, Sample mean, Principal values, Principal components. 
Happy PCA-ing! ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š
